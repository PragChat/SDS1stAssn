Hello.
I am Pragyansh Chaturvedi. My Slack ID is raikou and Discord ID is Raikou.

This is the README file for HTML-CSS Assignment.

I went forward with an Ubuntu Terminal Theme (Black BG, only grey and green colors)

Some commands have been shown to accentuate the theme.

The website is responsive for all devices with screen width > 350 px. This is because my Title animation interferes with it. The width had to be defined using pixels because defining using percentage would wrap the text, which gives undesirable results
Media queries have been used to enhance responsiveness across devices.

Webkit CSS has been used as some animations were not working on chromium browsers.

It has one homepage, one about page and one contact form.

Code and the required svg and image files have been uploaded.

Clickable links will get highlighted when hovered. Comments (just like in terminal) also instruct what to do.

A footer gives links to my FB, GitHub and Mail.

The CSS might look cluttered. That's because I didn't create an external CSS at the start. And there're changes in every page. And I was running out o time for the same.
I am sorry. I learnt from this that one external CSS should always be maintained for similar looking webpages from the start.

You can view the site.

Thank you.
